React E-Commerce App Documentation: Sample E-Commerce Site
===================================================

#### Code made by: Dylan Cook ([@dcook3](https://github.com/dcook3))

### Project Description
This site is a basic E-Commerce site meant to exhibit my skills in React.JS and MERN technologies. I plan to add more features on it as I go along. The site features a full MERN stack (Mongo, Express, React, Node) and pulls product data from a MongoDB database through an express API middleware app, located at [this repository](https://github.com/dcook3/rProj-api). The site displays that data back to the user in a modern, mobile-friendly and responsive view.

### Site Link
[Deployment Link](https://earnest-trifle-07d235.netlify.app) - WIP, will be more functional with the addition of a better CI/CD

### Features
- Full MERN stack implementing a single-page React.JS frontend, an Express JS node server middleware, and MongoDB backend
- Fully managed MongoDB database hold product records for display
- Database-held image support for product records
- Responsive and mobile-friendly frontend using Bootstrap breakpoints
- And more!


### Planned Features
Currently planned features for this app include enhanced API and frontend security, admin access for the addition of new products, deletion of old products, and the ability to edit existing products. 

TL:DR - Full CRUD functionality is the goal here, as well as enhanced security on the website and API projects. I also plan on adding CI/CD for both the site and API projects.
